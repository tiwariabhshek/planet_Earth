            While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it
            is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the
            surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the
            biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are
            made of rock and metal.

            Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does
            not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old
            English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of
            course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages
            spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.

            oxygen and 1 percent other ingredientsâ€”the perfect balance to

            We love this story, and I tell my students we each have a special
            place on the map. To start, I teach my students what a map is and
            how to use one. Chances are they have seen a map and globe before,
            and we review our vocabulary charts from last week. Maps help us see
            the world like a bird does - from the top looking down. They help us
            find where we are going and shows us more about the world around us.
            We labeled the continents last week, so students saw the world with

            On the first anniversary of the oil blowout, January 28, 1970,
            Environmental Rights Day was created, and the Declaration of
            Environmental Rights was read. It had been written by Rod Nash
            during a boat trip across the Santa Barbara Channel while carrying a
            copy of Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence.[15]
